      <p>What is TARDISCO?
        Time And Relative Dimensions in Sound.
        
        Who are we?
        We are Nick and Sharyn (aka the Doctor and Missy), Melbourne's favourite Doctor Who themed vinyl DJs.
        
        What do we do?
        We play some songs you know and some obscure, without the prejudice of time.
        
        What can I expect to hear?
        Remember when you were young, your dad was playing music and a song came on that really nailed it? That's TARDISCO. 
        
        What kind of genres do you play?
        An eclectic mix of styles, mostly from the 70s and 80s, spanning disco, synth pop, classic rock, soul, Oz rock, new wave, post punk, funk, yacht rock and everything in between.
        
        Hmm. Sounds like a bunch of white guys.
        No! Tardisco is all about diversity. We pride ourselves on finding and playing tracks, sometimes lost to the ages, from women, people of colour, & LGBT artists.
        
        What kind of artists can I expect to hear?
        Think Dragon, Blondie, the Doobie Brothers, David Bowie, Whitney Houston, Cheap Trick, Kate Bush, Talking Heads, Phil Collins, Stevie Wonder, the Isley Brothers, Bronski Beat, Joe Jackson, Australian Crawl, Chaka Khan and so many more.
        
        Where can I see you in action?
        We've played at a stack of bars and pubs, including regular sets at the Edinburgh Castle (Brunswick), Eydies (Brunswick East) and the Cherry Tree Hotel (Richmond).
        
        What kind of spots are you available for?
        Any time you need music, we are on hand.
        
        What are your rates?
        Our standard rate is $40 per hour but we are happy to discuss other pricing models with you.
